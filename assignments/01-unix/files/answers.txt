                      Declaration of Independence

                   [Adopted in Congress 4 July 1776]



   The Unanimous Declaration of the Thirteen United States of America

When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to
dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to
assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to
which the laws of nature and of nature's God entitle them, a decent respect
to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes
which impel them to the separation.



##Show a command that shows how many lines are in "foo"
$ wc -l foo

[mal1@login2 files]$ wc -l foo
97 foo

##You might have expected that the total number of lines in the previous question would be 45 (15 * 3), 
but it should not be. Why is it more or less?
Because it prints the file name between headers, unless use the option -q (-quiet) to never print headers with file name.
"$ head -q *.txt -n 15 >> foo "
##Remove the file called "foo"
$ rm foo
